There is three type of users in linux:
1- Normal user : genral purpose and everyday user accounts
2- system users: these are similar to reqular user accounts except the may lack a login
shell or a home directory
3- superusers : these are privilaged user accounts with full access to system resources

in linux only the root user and users with sudo privilages can create modify or delete 
user accounts


Creating users
#)adduser amir
cat /etc/passwd : the "x" character that you see in /etc/passwd file represent 
encrypted password

passwords saved in /etc/shadow file

you can check if a Linux user has sudo privilages using following command; sudo -v
if after running sudo -v command it prompts you for a password,it means that your user has
sudoer privilages

for add a new user to sudoer list run the following commands:
sudo visudo
add this line :::> USERNAME ALL=(ALL) {/usr/bin/vim - ALL}

sudo -v command validate user again

for show add users list run this command: 
cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1 | column


usermod -d /local/amir -m -s /bin/bash amir :::> this command chege home directory to /local/amir
also -s represent selected shell for this user and -m represent move all files in old home directory to new one

the following command restrict user to SSH access. usermod -L amir
and the following command with restore systemaccess for the user : usermod -U amir


as you can see you can edit sudoer file with more safety with visudo , we can edit users detail with
"vipw" command

Delete user
for delete a user only run this command : userdell -f(force) -r(delete home directory) amir

for edit /etc/shadow file you can use "vipw -s" command

ls -l :::>
ten character . first one represent file type and nine other represent permissions
first three character represent user owner permissions
second three character represent group owner permissions
third three character represent all other users permissions

file types in linux:
d : directory
p : pipe
s : socket
l : softlink
- : regular file
b : block device
c : character device similar to a block device

change ownership of a file
chmod u-w,o+x,ug+r filename
chmod 775 filename

to create no login user :::> useradd -M (--no-create-home) --shell /bin/false USERNAME
