chapter3 - linux software management
beside Deb and rpm packcages, there are two new package types that have been recently introduced,
the snap packages developes by ubuntu and flatpak package developed by large community of developers and organizations.

what does a DEB package consist of?
first of all we download a simple deb package with following command: 
wget https://downloads.slack-edge.com/linux_releases/slack-desktop-4.8.0-amd64.deb

then extract .deb file with ar command.ar command extract .a file formats:
ar x PACKAGE_NAME

as you can see we have four files:
debian_binary 
control.tar.gz
data.tar.xz : consists of configuration files that are necessary to run the application


we have flatpak and snap alongside of DEB and RPM.these packages designed to run every app in an isolate envirnement.
