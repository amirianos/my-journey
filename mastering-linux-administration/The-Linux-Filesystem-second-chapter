Editor tricks
:/ = enter search mode; this searches forward in your file
:? = enter search mode; this searcher backward in your file

linux file systems
-----------------------------------------------------------
If you use the touch command back-to-back, only the timestamp will change . page 60
ls -l = long listing format
we have 3 type of time in ls command:
1- modification time: represent change and modification time in content of file ===> ls -l
2- access time: represent last read and access to file content time ===> ls -lu
3- change time: change time refers to last time the files meradata(permisinos ownership etc) was changed ===> ls -lc

Note : if your times dosent change even if you run cat command on file, check fstab file
in some cases for prevent system performance from decreasing, you can add noatime in fstab file. with this config os dosent check last update time frequently

Links in linux
at all we have two type of links in linux. symbolic link and hard link
symbolic link create with "ln -s source target"
hard link create with "ln source target"
these are some diffrents:
1-Symlink can span accros devices while hardlink cannot
2-If the path or name of the source file changes, a symlink becomes broken, whereas a hard link continues to function properly
3-In hardlink source and target file has same inode number but in symlink source and target file has diffrent inode number and seperate commpletly


Head
head command can show some lines from beggining of text file
"head filename" => show 10 line from beggining of file
"head -n NUMBER filename" => show some lines from beggining of file


Stat
This command provides you with all the information about a file at once.

File types in linux:
d = directory
- = file
s = socket
b = block device
l = symlink
c = character device
p = pipe

Pipe and Socket in linux?
In summary, both pipes and sockets are used for interprocess communication, but pipes have a limitation and cannot communicate over a network, while sockets function properly in this regard.

Tar
tar -cvf file-archive.tar files/
if you wana add compression to commands above: tar -czvf filename.tar.gz ./files/

Find
find / -type f -name "file*.*"
find / -type f \( -name "*.c" -o -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.py*"\)
find / -type f -perm 0644
find / -perm /u=r => have read only permission
find / -type f -mtime 2 => find all file inside the root directory that were modified 2 days ago
find / -type f -atime 2 => find all file inside the root directory that were accessed 2 days ago
find / -type f -mtime +2 -mtime -5 => find all the files that have been modifies in the last 2 to 5 days
find / -type f -cmin -10 => find all the files that have been created in the last 10 minute
find / -type f -size +5M -size -10M
find /etc -type f -exec ls -s {} \; | sort -n | head -5 => find 5 largest file in /etc directory
To compress all configuration files located in the /etc directory => find /etc -type f -name '*.conf' -exec tar -rvf testtar.tar {} \;

Grep
find last time the sudo command was used => grep sudo /var/log/auth.log
search for the packt string inside text files => grep -R packt /etc
if you want to display the model of your cpu, you could use the following command:
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -i 'Model' => -i is for ignore-case

Wc
wc -l filename => this command gives us the number of lines inside of a file

Sed
sed 's/^/   /g' filename => this command add three space at the begining of lines inside of a files
s stands for substitiution
g stands for global

Awk
awk is much more than a simple command.it is a pattern-matching language.
yum list installed | awk '{print $1}' | wc -l => show number of installed packages
